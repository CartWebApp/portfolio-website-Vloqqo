                <h2>SuperCar Website</h2>
                <p>In this project I worked with a partner to create a website for a multi-million supercar company.
                    This required many steps like conducting market research, making a design, then actually coding the
                    website. I learned many things from this project, mainly how to better use my html and css to put
                    together a pleasing
                    project. It also helped me dip my toes into JS and using AI apis.</p>

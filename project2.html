            <h2>Budget Calculator</h2>
            <p>In this project we were tasked with creating a budget calculator that a credit card company could use for their website. We were told to code in all of the possible jobs they had from a database. The jobs in the database came with a salary that was used to automatically calculate the user's budget. This information was displayed with a dynamic chart.</p>

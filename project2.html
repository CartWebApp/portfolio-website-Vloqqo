            <h2>Budget Calculator</h2>
            <p>In this project we were tasked with creating a budget calculator that a credit card company could use for their website. We were told to code in all of the possible jobs they had from a database. The jobs in the database came with a salary that was used to automatically calculate the user's budget. This information was displayed with a dynamic chart. This project helped me to learn how to prepare for last minuet accomadations in client requests. It also helped me better understand JS and become more efficient in using it.</p>

        <h2>The Monday Blues</h2>
        <p>A loud electric blair sounds throughout a small room, in it a man’s brain desperately clings to the state of unconsciousness it is in, but it is no use, as the noise is a constant ringing only getting more and more annoying. The sound prevails and the man gets up and goes into the bathroom. Looking at the mirror the only thing that stares back are the eyebags on his face. His head bobs right to left and barely fights against his instincts so he gets in the shower. As he gets in he is greeted with the hot steam and water that relaxes his body from built up stress from working his job. He wishes he could stay in all day but he has to get to work and promptly gets out after he is finished washing. As he gets in the car the only thing he can think of is the dread that awaits him at his job.</p>
        <p>He gets out with the cold sharp breeze feeling as though it is cutting through his body, and walks towards the building. Nobody talks to him, sensing his overall demeanor as he gets into the elevator. The musty dampness of the room invades Tom’s nostrils as the elevator doors open. He walks with a slight unsteadiness to his cubicle and begins his endless pile of work. His mind can only think of the rest he’ll be able to get if he just sticks out a couple more hours. Endless typing consumes his mind and destroys his fingers, he takes a few breaks from typing but like the Sun and the Moon his pain is reoccurring. The hours fly and so do the people he calls, words he types, and his sanity. When he is done with his work he feels no sense of accomplishment, all he thinks about is sleep. He tries to get in his car but he can feel that he is in no shape to be driving. As he realizes that he decides to take a nap in the back of his car. He takes the keys out of the ignition, the weather is mild enough he won't need heat, and lays in the back with only a jacket to make his sleep easier.</p>

                <h2>Adventure Game</h2>
                <p>I worked on this with a partner with the goal to make a game with branching decisions that could
                    affect the ending. We decided to put in mechanics like combat and puzzles. Although as of this date I have not finished the project, I felt that it has helped me learn to better
            coordinate with others and help better my teamworking skills.</p>

        <h2>3D Prints</h2>
        <p>One of my hobbies is working on my 3d printer and printing everyday things. This hobby has taught me patience and how to tinker with the little things in order to perfect the bigger picture. The most recent thing I printed was a laptop stand which will be pictured to the left.</p>

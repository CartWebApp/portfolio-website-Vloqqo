            <h2>Word Scrambler</h2>
            <p>This was a passion project that was done solely out of my own free time. The way this works is that it randomly selects a word from a list of words then scrambles that word. That scrambled word is then shown to the user using a spinner.</p>

        <p>I experimented with databases in this project (although that is still an ongoing thing). It also helped me learn how to use JS when I first started out.</p>
